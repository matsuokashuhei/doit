# Statement of Work: Phase 4 - Progress Calculation Logic Implementation

## Project Overview

### Task Name
Phase 4: Progress Calculation Logic Implementation

### Task Description
Implement the core progress calculation logic that determines the percentage based on elapsed time between start time, end time, and current time. This is a critical component that will be used by the progress bar rendering system.

### Dependencies
- Issue #1: Project structure (Completed)
- Issue #3: Error handling system (Completed)
- Issue #5: Date format parsing (Completed)
- Issue #6: DateTime format parsing (Completed)
- Issue #7: Relative time parsing (Completed)
- `chrono` crate dependency (Already configured)

## Scope of Work

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Progress Calculation Function
**Function Signature**: `pub fn calculate_progress(start: NaiveDateTime, end: NaiveDateTime, current: NaiveDateTime) -> f64`

**Functionality**:
- Calculate progress percentage based on start time, end time, and current time
- Handle edge cases: zero duration, negative progress, >100% progress
- Return accurate floating-point percentage
- Optimize for performance (called frequently during updates)
- Handle time arithmetic correctly
- Ensure thread safety

#### 2. Algorithm Implementation
**Core Formula**: 
```
Progress % = (Current Time - Start Time) / (End Time - Start Time) × 100
```

**Edge Case Handling**:
- **Zero Duration**: When start == end, return 100.0%
- **Negative Progress**: When current < start, return 0.0% (clamp to non-negative)
- **Over 100%**: When current > end, return actual percentage (e.g., 110%, 200%)
- **Precision**: Maintain floating-point accuracy for sub-second precision

#### 3. Performance Optimization
**Requirements**:
- Function execution time: <1ms per call
- Memory usage: Minimal (no heap allocation)
- Thread safety: Function must be safe for concurrent access
- Efficient time arithmetic using chrono's built-in operations

#### 4. Integration Points
**Module Integration**:
- Add function to `progress_bar.rs` module
- Export function in `lib.rs` for external use
- Ensure compatibility with existing time parsing functions
- Prepare for integration with rendering logic

## Implementation Details

### Core Implementation
```rust
pub fn calculate_progress(start: NaiveDateTime, end: NaiveDateTime, current: NaiveDateTime) -> f64 {
    let total_duration = end - start;
    let elapsed_duration = current - start;
    
    if total_duration.num_seconds() == 0 {
        return 100.0;
    }
    
    let progress = (elapsed_duration.num_seconds() as f64 / total_duration.num_seconds() as f64) * 100.0;
    progress.max(0.0) // Ensure non-negative
}
```

### Test Cases Implementation
**Normal Progress Cases**:
- 0% progress: current == start
- 25% progress: current at 1/4 through duration
- 50% progress: current at midpoint
- 75% progress: current at 3/4 through duration
- 100% progress: current == end

**Edge Cases**:
- Over time: 110%, 200% (current > end)
- Before start: current < start (should return 0%)
- Same start/end time: start == end (should return 100%)

**Precision Testing**:
- Test floating-point accuracy with fractional percentages
- Test with different time scales (seconds, minutes, hours, days)
- Test boundary conditions

**Performance Testing**:
- Benchmark function execution time
- Test with large time ranges
- Verify memory usage patterns
